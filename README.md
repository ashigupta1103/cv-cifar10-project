Simple CNN classifier on CIFAR-10.

## How to run
1. Open `notebooks/cifar10_classification.ipynb` in JupyterLab.
2. Run cells top-to-bottom. (If running locally, ensure `tensorflow` installed.)

## Files
- `notebooks/cifar10_classification.ipynb` - notebook with code & plots
- `cifar10_cnn_model.keras` - saved model
- `results/figures/` - saved figures (confusion matrix, training curves)

## Results
- Final test accuracy: (paste your number here)
- Notes: (briefly write 1-2 lines about what went well and what could be improved)
