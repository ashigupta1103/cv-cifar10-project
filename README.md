## Project Overview
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset**.  
CIFAR-10 consists of **60,000 32x32 color images** in **10 classes**: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.  
The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, saving, and deployment.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)  
- **Classes:** 10  
- **Training Images:** 50,000  
- **Test Images:** 10,000  

CIFAR-10 images are small (32x32 pixels), making it a standard benchmark for CNNs with manageable training time.

## Results

Test Accuracy: ~85%

Confusion Matrix

<!-- replace with actual path if needed -->

# Observations:

The model performs best on classes like airplane and ship.
Some classes like cat and dog are slightly misclassified due to visual similarity.

## Future Work

### -Implement data augmentation to improve generalization.
### -Explore transfer learning with pre-trained models like ResNet or VGG.
### -Deploy as a fully functional web application with real-time image input.
### -Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve model accuracy.
### -Add model explainability using Grad-CAM or other visualization techniques.
